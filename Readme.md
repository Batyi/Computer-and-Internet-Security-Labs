# Computer & Internet Security Labs
Here the most common computer and internet attack will be considered based on the solving SEED Project Labs: https://seedsecuritylabs.org/

## Motivation
Part of these labs were completed during the "Cyber Security Lab" course at Brandenburgische Technische Universit√§t Cottbus-Zenftenberg. Other labs were solved as part of a self-learning exploration of the SEEDlabs. Content of SEEDlabs project is significant and allows to understand the most common attacks in Computer and Network Security.
